Design and implement a lexical analyzer using Lex/Flex to recognize valid Roman numerals. 
Write a Lex program to identify valid Roman numerals (I, V, X, L, C, D, M) and reject invalid sequences (e.g., IC, VX, IIV). Display recognized tokens.
Modify the Lex program to provide meaningful error messages for invalid Roman numeral sequences and test it with various inputs.
